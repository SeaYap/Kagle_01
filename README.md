# Store Sales_ Kaggle
Participation on Kaggle's competition

**The challenge** is predict the sales with this data: category's products, climates's change at the geographic zone and customer's preferences.

**The objective** is create a Machine Learning model to predict the sales of thousands products selled in stores located in the zone.

**Potencial impact:** If it's succesfull I have flexed some new skills in a real world example.
   For grocery stores, more accurate forecasting can decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction. The results of this     
   ongoing competition, over time, might even ensure your local store has exactly what you need the next time you shop.
